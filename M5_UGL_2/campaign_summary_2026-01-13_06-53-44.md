   – Delivers broad appeal through timeless design and premium materials  
 • Retro-Inspired Statement Shapes  
   – Cat-eye and angular square frames with vintage details  
   – Targets fashion-driven segments craving distinctive, Instagram-ready pieces  

2. Strategic Product Picks  
 • SG004 “Sport” Wraparound  
   – Leverages the season’s shield aesthetic with full-lens coverage and a bold, modern silhouette  
   – Positioned as an active-lifestyle hero SKU, ideal for outdoor recreation marketing campaigns  
 • SG001 “Aviator” Thin-Metal Teardrop

   – Captures retro-glamour through upswept frames and subtle embellishment at the temples  
   – Creates aspirational buzz among trendsetters while maintaining accessible price points  

3. Business Impact & Next Steps  
 • Margin Opportunity: Slim metal and wraparound styles command premium pricing; retro statement shapes can drive incremental accessory sales.

   – “Sport” wraparound: Partner with lifestyle influencers in outdoor sports.  
   – Aviator: Leverage heritage storytelling and digital try-on tools.  
   – Cat-eye: Showcase in fashion editorials and targeted social media drops.
